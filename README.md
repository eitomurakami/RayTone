# RayTone
## A Node-based Audiovisual Sequencing Environment
**_RayTone_** is a node-based software environment for creating audiovisual compositions. The software emphasizes the aesthetics and joy of patching procedures, aiming to promote a playful workflow for transforming creative ideas into artistic content. RayTone allows for native access to ChucK music programming language and OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), affording programmability of arbitrary complexity inside each node on canvas.
